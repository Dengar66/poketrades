<h2>How to use this tool</h2>

<p>In order to use this tool you need to use a google spreadsheet as a database and make it public.</p>
<p>The link to that spreadsheet template (the "template") and a description how to use it can be found on <a
  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/jgn8ly/gen_8_collection_template_3_the_return_of_the_king/">reddit.com</a>
</p>
<p>More templates might come later.</p>

<h3>Preparing the template</h3>
<p>Before anything you have to make a copy of the template and save it in your own Google Drive.<br>
  Open the template url, click on "File" and click on "Make a copy" to copy the template to your Google Drive.</p>

<p>A dialog should have been opened and shows an option at the bottom to unfold "Published content & settings".
  <br>If it's already opened just proceed to the next step. </p>

<p>Click on the dropdown field and deselect "Entire document".
  <br>You can now select all tabs you want to publish.</p>

<h3>Using a published spreadsheet</h3>

<p>To use a published speadsheet, which is based on the template, you just have to enter the ID in the URL like:
  <br><code>https://koenig.gg/poketrades/1Vv5VjgTBECyq4iTODtok9JEYR8lWRd5L2ekTD5QaC2M</code></p>
<p>Alternatively you can enter the ID in the <a routerLink="/change-spreadsheet">spreadsheet changer</a> to preview the
  spreadsheet and save it in your history!
  <br>(The history is only visible on your current device)</p>

<p>You can get your ID from the URL from your spreadsheet.
  <br>Its the part between the two slashes after the <code>spreadsheets/d</code> in your spreadsheet URL.</p>
